A [Riparian Forest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Riparian_forest#:~:text=A%20riparian%20forest%20or%20riparian,%2C%20canal%2C%20sink%20or%20reservoir.)

A recently abandoned campsite. Footsteps lead to a cave that was previously obscured by ice. The ice sheet covering the entrance has cracked, revealing a dark crevasse in a rocky hillside.

Folklore tells of the [[Frostbound Guardian]] - a mysterious being said to dwell within the depths of a cave, guarding an ancient artifact or source of power.
