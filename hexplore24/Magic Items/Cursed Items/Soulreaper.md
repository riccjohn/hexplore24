#### Cursed Dagger

- **Curse Effect**
    - The cursed dagger, known as Soulreaper, feeds upon the life force of its wielder. Whenever the dagger is drawn or held, it siphons 1d4 hit points from the wielder
- **Life-Stealing Mechanism**
    - However, the malevolent magic embedded in Soulreaper grants a twisted boon to its wielder. If the wielder successfully kills a living creature with the dagger, the weapon channels the stolen life force, returning 1d12 hit points to the wielder. Extra hitpoints will boost the wielder's maximum HP for 24 hours.
- **Malevolent Whispers**
    - The dagger whispers sinister thoughts and temptations to its wielder, encouraging them to embrace the dark power it offers. The more the dagger is used, the stronger its influence becomes, gradually corrupting the wielder's thoughts.
- **Haunting Visions**
    - The wielder may experience haunting visions of the souls trapped within the dagger, especially during moments of rest or meditation. These visions can be disturbing and unsettling, testing the mental resilience of the one who bears Soulreaper.
    - Save vs spell while resting after wielding the dagger.
	    - Fail: tormented by visions, cannot sleep
- **Breaking the Curse**
    - Breaking the curse of Soulreaper requires a potent ritual or the intervention of a powerful divine being. The dagger itself is resistant to mundane attempts to destroy it, and it may resist being willingly discarded by its wielder.
- **Concealed Engravings**
    - Tiny, almost imperceptible engravings on the dagger's blade reveal the history of the souls it has claimed. The engravings glow faintly when the dagger is in use, serving as an ominous reminder of its dark nature.
