The Radiant Sanctum of [[Pholtus]] was a glorious temple dedicated to Pholtus, the god of light. Its sacred halls were once filled with the warm glow of divine radiance. 

Over time, the Radiant Sanctum fell into neglect and eventual abandonment. The light that once bathed the temple in a celestial radiance gradually dimmed, leaving the sanctum vulnerable to the encroachment of malevolent forces. Now, the once-holy site stands as a haunting monument to the passage of ages.

The divine light of Pholtus has long faded, replaced by an oppressive darkness that attracts creatures of the night. [[Assassin vine]]s, entwined with the remnants of the temple's beauty, now pose a threat to any intruders. Wraiths and undead spirits, drawn by the echoes of a lost faith, roam the desolate halls, forever mourning the sanctuary's fall from grace.

Within the Radiant Sanctum of Pholtus, adventurers may uncover the secrets of its ancient past, confront the malevolent forces that have taken residence, and perhaps even rekindle the divine light that once graced this sacred place. The journey through its broken halls promises danger, mystery, and the potential for redemption in the face of darkness.

### Ground Level

#### 1. Overgrown Graveyard
