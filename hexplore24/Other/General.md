**Miles per day:** The number of miles a character can travel in a day is _**determined by dividing their base movement rate by five**_. For example, a character whose base movement rate is 120’ could travel up to 24 miles in a day.

### Terrain Modifiers

Some types of terrain modify the speed at which characters can travel:

- **Broken lands, desert, forest, hills:** 33% slower. (18 mi/day becomes ~12 mi/day)
- **Jungle, mountains, swamp:** 50% slower. (18 mi/day becomes 9)
- **Maintained roads:** 50% faster. (18 mi becomes 27)
