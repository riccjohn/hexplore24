# Movement Rate

**Miles per day:** The number of miles a character can travel in a day is _**determined by dividing their base movement rate by five**_. For example, a character whose base movement rate is 120’ could travel up to 24 miles in a day.

### Terrain Modifiers

Some types of terrain modify the speed at which characters can travel:

- **Broken lands, desert, forest, hills:** 33% slower. (18 mi/day becomes ~12 mi/day)
- **Jungle, mountains, swamp:** 50% slower. (18 mi/day becomes 9)
- **Maintained roads:** 50% faster. (18 mi becomes 27)

|  | Default | Broken Lands, Desert, Forest, Hills (-33%) | Jungle, Mountains, Swamp (-50%) | Maintained Roads (+50%) |
| ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- | ---- |
|  | 24 | 16 | 12 | 36 |
|  | 18 | 12 | 9 | 27 |
|  | 6 | 4 | 3 | 9 |
|  | 3 | 2 | 1.5 | 4.5 |


### Wandering Monsters

**Frequency**: A check is typically rolled once per day, but the referee may choose to make more checks: up to three or four per day.

**Chance**: The chance of encountering a wandering monster depends on the terrain being explored (see below).

**Distance**: Wandering monsters are encountered 4d6 × 10 yards away. If either side is surprised (see Encounters, p228), this is reduced to 1d4 × 10 yards.

**Chance by Terrain**

- City, clear, grasslands, settled lands: 1-in-6.
- Aerial, barren, desert, forest, hills: 2-in-6.
- Jungle, mountains, swamp: 3-in-6.
